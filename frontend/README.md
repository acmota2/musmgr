# Frontend: React -> SvelteKit

The project was initially prototyped in React. I made the deliberate decision to migrate to **SvelteKit**, finding its approach to reactivity and routing logic much simpler and more integrated.

## Why SvelteKit?

The decision to completely rewrite the frontend in SvelteKit was one of the best technical decisions made for this project, and it's a technology I now fully support.

The migration process itself was a revelation. A rewrite that I expected to take weeks was completed in less than one week. The resulting application faster and less jittery, while the codebase was dramatically smaller, more readable, and easier to maintain.

Key Advantages That Drove This Decision:

- First-Class Developer Experience: SvelteKit's documentation is clear and concise. This made the transition from React almost frictionless.

- Simplicity and Power: SvelteKit's approach almost removes entire categories of problems (like complex state management) that are common in other frameworks.

- True Performance: Svelte is a compiler that generates highly optimized, minimal JavaScript. It doesn't ship a large virtual DOM, resulting in exceptional performance that is noticeable immediately.
